	- adds medical facilities to link to your beds
	- needs to be researched, 3 research projects (medieval, industrial, space)
	- adds 3 medieval facilites, 2 industrial facilicies (you have the vanilla vitals monitor as the third), 3 spacy facilities
	- all stuff can be linked to the vanilla beds
	- the boni from the linked facilities are immunity gain and treatment quality only
	- the boni are quite low, but the will influence the game balance. please keep that in mind!
	
	This mod does NOT:
	
	- it does NOT change the games mechanic in treating, illness and operations.
	- it does NOT add any additional beds.
	- it does NOT work with beds added by other mods if not specified by the mod. (includes patches for most bed mods)
